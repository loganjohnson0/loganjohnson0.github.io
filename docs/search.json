    "text": "I am a PhD student at Iowa State University in the Department of Animal Sciences. I am passionate about understanding the fundamental biology and biochemistry associated with livestock growth and meat production. Data science has become another passion of mine. I am involved in a National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Traineeship Program at Iowa State University called DataFEWSion. Through this program, I meet weekly with a cohort of interdisciplinary PhD students from across various departments. We discuss and learn from each other about data-analytics skills at the nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (FEWS). We also grow our professional and communication skills through our symposium with external stakeholders and through our Graduate Certificate course work on Data-Drive Food, Energy, and Water Decision Making. All together, I am applying the skills and knowledge I gain on data science and analytics to the animal science, livestock production, and meat quality research areas.\n\n\n\nReview of postmortem protein oxidation in skeletal muscle and the role of the peroxiredoxin family of endogenous antioxidants.
